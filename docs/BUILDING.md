# Project Configuration (Full freedom to modify in anyway seemed best)

## Prelude
- You may edit any of these if you want to change, add, remove, or in any other way modify these concepts that were generated by an LLM and tweaked slightly by the user who is not perfectly informed.

## Build Requirements (Full freedom to modify in anyway seemed best)
- C++17 compiler
- CMake 3.10 or higher (latest version on Arch Linux is `4.0.3-1` and you may optionally use any other packages relating to cmake or similar whether available on the arch linux repositories, arch user repository via paru or yay, or compiled from source such as leatherman, cmake-extras, corrosion, extra-cmake-modules, or icmake if it aides in the project in any way)
- Qt 5.15 or higher (6.x latest is primary target)
- projectm v4.x.x (git master branch; make sure when cloning it the external directory that it is cloned with --recursive to ensure all submodules are cloned)
- FFmpeg libraries (libavcodec, libavformat, libswscale) which should be available on most users system if an ffmpeg package is installed by their package manager.
- TagLib or similar may be useful for audio files.
- Many more that are unforseed and thus you will have full freedom.

## Boilerplate CMake Options (Full freedom to modify in anyway seemed best)
- `USE_QT6` - Build with Qt6 instead of Qt5 (default: ON)
- `ENABLE_VIDEO_RECORDING` - Enable video recording feature (default: ON)
- `ENABLE_DEBUG` - Enable debug logging (default: OFF but we will probably want any debug logging that we intergrate for development purposes early on)

## Boilerplate Directory Structure (Full freedom to modify in anyway seemed best)
```
src/          # Source code
include/      # Header files
res/          # Resources (icons, shaders)
docs/         # Documentation
build/        # Build directory (gitignored)
external/     # External projects source from github (susch as the projectM-4 source code, any helper libraries etc; see sub-section note below)
```
### External codebases
- You may use any other libraries, projects, or any other means that contain, source-code from any project. This means you may use search MCP abilities to find repositories at github.com via a search engine or if your host virtual machine, or on the users system if coding agentically, github-cli installed then you may run `gh search repos --sort stars <SEARCH TERM - DO NOT PLACE IN QUOTES UNLESS YOU WANT TO DO A STRICT SEARCH FOR THAT EXACT PHRASE RATHER THAN ALL SPACE SEPARATED WORDS IN COMBINATION>`,

## Boilerplate Build Targets (Full freedom to modify in anyway seemed best)
- `vibestream` - Main application
- `vibestream-test` - Unit tests (if use and enabled)
